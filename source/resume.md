Education
---------

**North Carolina State University, Fall 2002–Spring 2006  
Bachelor of Science in Computer Science—GPA 3.18**

The completion of my master's studies (which were the continuation of the "Research Assistant" job mentioned at the bottom of the "Experience" section) was placed on hold due to the events surrounding the death of my thesis advisor.

Experience
----------

**Application Support Engineer, November 2012–November 2014  
Google, Mountain View, CA**

- One year contract position on the Street View and aerial imagery collection teams, extended to two years after positive evaluations.
- Provided immediate and ongoing systems support while automating the processes I supported to enable scaling novel projects to full production capacity.
- Ensured SLAs were met by coordinating with field personnel at remote locations to initiate, preserve, and restore the functioning of complex data collection/transmission systems.
- Assisted in the development and implementation of rapid-scaling processes, allowing us to quickly transition from pilot projects to worldwide operations.

**Systems Engineer, July 2011–January 2012  
Autonomy Corporation, Pleasanton, CA**

- Deployed new installations of a custom Linux distribution.
- Wrote Perl scripts to automate customer-visible monitoring tasks using nagios.

**Junior System Administrator, February 2007–May 2009  
EMC Corporation, Research Triangle Park, NC**

- Was responsible for identifying faults in and troubleshooting 10–20 storage arrays with around 1,000 disks total.
- Maintained automatic scripts for testing the I/O performance of development software and prototype hardware, and for archiving and reporting the results.
- Developed a web application for internal use in Perl, which monitored the health of the storage arrays, logged any errors it found to a MySQL database, and allowed viewing of current status as well as generating reports regarding when an error had first been seen.
- Set up and maintained a VMWare ESX cluster which was a critical part of my team's infrastructure.

**Research Assistant, October 2005–August 2006  
North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC**

- Developed alternate algorithms using Matlab to compute solutions to Google's PageRank problem. Characterized performance of PageRank algorithms on different input datasets.
- Gave a talk at the A. A. Markov Anniversary Meeting in June 2006.
