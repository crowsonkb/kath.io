Education
---------

**North Carolina State University, Fall 2002–Spring 2006  
Bachelor of Science in Computer Science—GPA 3.18**

Experience
----------

**Machine learning self-study, July 2015–present**

- Replicated multiple results from researchers in the field.
- Machine learning art project implementing image stylization.
- Improving on state-of-the-art results, implementation of image stylization capable of generating arbitrarily large output images using multiple GPUs.

**Application Support Engineer, November 2012–November 2014  
Google, Mountain View, CA**

- One year contract position on the Street View and aerial imagery collection teams, extended to two years after positive evaluations.
- Provided immediate and ongoing systems support while automating the processes I supported to enable scaling novel projects to full production capacity.
- Ensured SLAs were met by coordinating with field personnel at remote locations to initiate, preserve, and restore the functioning of complex data collection/transmission systems.
- Assisted in the development and implementation of rapid-scaling processes, allowing us to quickly transition from pilot projects to worldwide operations.

**Systems Engineer, July 2011–January 2012  
Autonomy Corporation, Pleasanton, CA**

- Deployed new installations of a custom Linux distribution.
- Wrote Perl scripts to automate customer-visible monitoring tasks using nagios.

**Junior System Administrator, February 2007–May 2009  
EMC Corporation, Research Triangle Park, NC**

- Was responsible for identifying faults in and troubleshooting 10–20 storage arrays with around 1,000 disks total.
- Maintained automatic scripts for testing the I/O performance of development software and prototype hardware, and for archiving and reporting the results.
- Developed a web application for internal use in Perl, which monitored the health of the storage arrays, logged any errors it found to a MySQL database, and allowed viewing of current status as well as generating reports regarding when an error had first been seen.
- Set up and maintained a VMWare ESX cluster which was a critical part of my team's infrastructure.

**Research Assistant, October 2005–August 2006  
North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC**

- Developed alternate algorithms using Matlab to compute solutions to Google's PageRank problem. Characterized performance of PageRank algorithms on different input datasets.
- Gave a talk at the A. A. Markov Anniversary Meeting in June 2006.
